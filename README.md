# Project-Euro-Exchange
Data Visualization Project

This project is one of dataquest.io guided projects. You can find data I have used [here](http://bioinf-mw.bihz.upwr.edu.pl/students-data/euro-daily-hist_1999_2020.csv)

The dataset we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolized with â‚¬) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

In this project, our main focus was on effectively presenting data in a simple and engaging way. We aimed to not only understand the information ourselves but also to clearly explain and demonstrate our findings to others. Through the use of clear plots and visualizations, we strived to provide easy-to-understand explanations of the patterns and insights we discovered. Our ultimate goal was to ensure that a wide range of people could easily grasp and appreciate our findings.
